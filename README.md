# SAT-Solvers
 Use several heuristic search techniques to find possibly optimal truth assignments for variables in the given Boolean formulas.

 # Using:
 - DPLL :  Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland algorithm is a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form
 - walkSAT & GSAT:  Local search algorithms to solve Boolean satisfiability problems.
